Template
 - [ ] Created an rstudio template for the *FPS* - not found.
 
FPS Should:

 - Introduction: 
   - [-] State the business problem in the title/first sentence or paragraph.
   - [ ] Identified one or more specific decision(s) that will be helped. 

 
 - [ ] Identify key roles: management, owners, stakeholders, users, SMEs, etc.
 - [ ] Clearly articulate **why** the project is being considered
 - [ ] Stated how/why the analysis would do.
   - [ ] Specify a quantitative business goal.
   - [ ] Estimate benefits of the project 
   - [ ] Identify any non-quantifiable benefits 
   
 - Define project's success
   - [ ] Define (very precisely) a success metric for the project: a single quantifiable, unambiguous 
     metric, that will be used to determine if your project is a success. This is
     not just a technical metrics, but one use at the managerial level. This of
     this is how "the needle must move" by your solution in order to be successful.
     
 - Define model/analysis success 
   - [ ] Define (very precisely) the performance/power of the model or analysis that 
     is necessary to achieve that success to achieve the success.

 - Estimate Risks
   - [ ] What if the success metric is not met?
   - [ ] What if the model performance metric is not met?

 - [x] Identify **who** the users of the model are and how the model will used 
 - [ ] Discuss what changes have to happen within the organization to deploy the model
 - [x] Discuss risks to model deployment, (e.g. push-back by employees )

 - [x] Propose a timeline for delivery of your project
   - [x] **When** you will have preliminary results of model/analysis performance
   - [x] **When** you need or expect to have determined whether the model performance 
   - [x] How much effort it will take to deploy the solutions.


## NOTES

 - What specific decision are you addressing, e.g.
   
    This project will help faculty advisers identify which students are at risk
    of not graduating on time 
   
 - You need to quantify what you are trying to accomplish, e.g.:
 
    This project proposed to help increase on-time graduation by 2%.
 
 - You need to propose the needed accuracy of the model, e.g.:
   
    The model needs to accurately predict students that will not graduate on time
    50% of the time.
