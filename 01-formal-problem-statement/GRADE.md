Template
 - [x] Created an rstudio template for the *FPS*
 
FPS Should:

 - Introduction: 
   - [x] State the business problem in the title/first sentence or paragraph.
   - [x] Identified one or more specific decision(s) that will be helped. 
   
 - [x] Identify key roles: management, owners, stakeholders, users, SMEs, etc.
 - [x] Clearly articulate **why** the project is being considered

 - Define project's success
   - [x] State what the analysis would do
   - [x] Estimate benefits of the project 
   - [x] Define/quantify (very precisely) a success metric for the project: a single quantifiable, unambiguous 
     metric, that will be used to determine if your project is a success. This is
     not just a technical metrics, but one use at the managerial level. This of
     this is how "the needle must move" by your solution in order to be successful.
   - [-] Identify any non-quantifiable benefits 
     
 - Define model/analysis success 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) the performance/power of the model or analysis that 
     is necessary to achieve that success to achieve the success.

 - Estimate Risks
   - [x] What if the success metric is not met?
   - [ ] What if the model performance metric is not met?

 - Deployment
   - [x] Identify **who** the users of the model/analysis are 
   - [x] Identify **how** the model/analysis will used 
   - [x] Discuss what changes have to happen within the organization to deploy the model
   - [x] Discuss risks to model deployment, (e.g. push-back by employees )

 - [x] Propose a timeline for delivery of your project
   - [x] **When** you will have preliminary results of model/analysis performance
   - [x] **When** you need or expect to have determined whether the model performance 
   - [x] How much effort it will take to deploy the solutions.


## NOTES

 - This is a really, really good effort. You are very articulate, concise and 
   organozed in your presentation.  
   
 - In the *Project Scope and Limitation Section* you identify four questions that 
   you intend to answer with the analysis... excellent.
   
 - IN terms of deployment/deliverables, it seems you have two
   - One for the Maintenance Team ... this is presumably a priotitized list of 
     engines and associated maintenance tasks?  
   - Dashboard for Management who tracks model performance (wouldn't this be likely
     oart of some existing maintenace report)
 
 - Do you have a strategy for measuring model performance pre-failure, e.g. 
   assessing the engine at maintenance time.  (Maybe you said this.)
