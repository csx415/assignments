title: "Rubric: Formal Problem Statement"
output: github_document
---

Template
 - [ ] Created an rstudio template for the *FPS*
 
FPS Should:

 - Introduction: 
   - [ ] State the business problem in the title/first sentence or paragraph.
   - [ ] Identified one or more specific decision(s) that will be helped. 
   
 - [ ] Identify key roles: management, owners, stakeholders, users, SMEs, etc.
 - [ ] Clearly articulate **why** the project is being considered
 - [ ] Identified "current"" state.

 - Define project's success
   - [ ] State what the analysis would do
   - [ ] Estimate benefits of the project 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) a success metric for the project: a single quantifiable, unambiguous 
     metric, that will be used to determine if your project is a success. This is
     not just a technical metrics, but one use at the managerial level. This of
     this is how "the needle must move" by your solution in order to be successful.
   - [ ] Identify any non-quantifiable benefits 
     
 - Define model/analysis success 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) the performance/power of the model or analysis that 
     is necessary to achieve that success to achieve the success.

 - Estimate Risks
   - [ ] What if the success metric is not met?
   - [ ] What if the model performance metric is not met?

 - Deployment
   - [ ] Identify **who** the users of the model/analysis are 
   - [ ] Identify **how** the model/analysis will used 
   - [ ] Discuss what changes have to happen within the organization to deploy the model
   - [ ] Discuss risks to model deployment, (e.g. push-back by employees )

 - [ ] Propose a timeline for delivery of your project
   - [ ] **When** you will have preliminary results of model/analysis performance
   - [ ] **When** you need or expect to have determined whether the model performance will be sufficient to solve the problem  
   - [ ] How much effort it will take to deploy the solutions.

 - [ ] Is free of grammar/spelling/punctuation mistakes
 

## NOTES

 - Love this project! You have set this up to be a successful project whether you succeed or not, though 
   it does break the mold for evaluating the FPS, so bear with me ...
 
 - Please continue to revise your FPS.
 
 - It does not appear as though you understand how to evaluate your recommendations. Say that
   your do recommend 5 hikes, what is your feedback that these are good hikes for the 
   user. I don't know that you need this but it makes it tricky to evaluate. Thus far
   it only seems that your success metric is to recommend five hikes and doesn't
   consider whether these are good or not.
   
 - Given your data, it is unclear how your will make these recommendations (technically)
   I can think of a number of ways and am interested in hearing what you come up with. 
 
 - Where is your *FPS* template?
 
 - I don't think that you need to include deployment and maintenance details in the **FPS**, 
   at this stage you generally do not know whether your model can achieve the desired
   results.
   
 - You should consider having the user enter 3 or more hikes to provide the recommendation ...
   if you require only one, than your recommendation are going to be arbitrary
