Template
 - [x] Created an rstudio template for the *FPS*
 
FPS Should:

 - Introduction:

   - [x] Identified one or more specific decision(s) that will be helped.

 - [x] Clearly articulate **why** the project is being considered

 - Define project's success
   - [x] State what the analysis would do
   - [ ] Estimate benefits of the project 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) a success metric for the project: a single quantifiable, unambiguous 
     metric, that will be used to determine if your project is a success. This is
     not just a technical metrics, but one use at the managerial level. This of
     this is how "the needle must move" by your solution in order to be successful.
   - [ ] Identify any non-quantifiable benefits 
     
 - Define model/analysis success 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) the performance/power of the model or analysis that 
     is necessary to achieve that success to achieve the success.

 - Estimate Risks
   - [ ] What if the success metric is not met?
   - [ ] What if the model performance metric is not met?

 - Deployment

   - [ ] Identify **how** the model/analysis will used 
   - [ ] Discuss what changes have to happen within the organization to deploy the model
   - [ ] Discuss risks to model deployment, (e.g. push-back by employees )

 - [ ] Propose a timeline for delivery of your project
   - [ ] **When** you will have preliminary results of model/analysis performance
   - [ ] **When** you need or expect to have determined whether the model performance 
   - [ ] How much effort it will take to deploy the solutions.


## NOTES

 - This is a really good effort. 
 
 - I think the *Opportunity* section is a bit buried and should be stated nearer 
   to the *Executive Summary* or combine the two.
   
 - I am not sure I understand what a *memo* order from the description which is probably alright since your audience would.
 
 - You get redunant in places
 
 - You need to figure out how the model will be used, presumably in the hands of the sales people?
