 - Define project's success
   - [ ] State what the analysis would do
   - [ ] Estimate benefits of the project 
   - [z] Define/quantify (very precisely) a success metric for the project: a single quantifiable, unambiguous 
     metric, that will be used to determine if your project is a success. This is
     not just a technical metrics, but one use at the managerial level. This of
     this is how "the needle must move" by your solution in order to be successful.
   - [ ] Identify any non-quantifiable benefits 
     
 - Define model/analysis success 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) the performance/power of the model or analysis that 
     is necessary to achieve that success to achieve the success.

 - Estimate Risks
   - [ ] What if the success metric is not met?
   - [ ] What if the model performance metric is not met?

 - Deployment
   - [z] Identify **who** the users of the model/analysis are 
   - [z] Identify **how** the model/analysis will used 
   - [ ] Discuss what changes have to happen within the organization to deploy the model
   - [z] Discuss risks to model deployment, (e.g. push-back by employees )

 - [x] Propose a timeline for delivery of your project
   - [x] **When** you will have preliminary results of model/analysis performance
   - [x] **When** you need or expect to have determined whether the model performance 
   - [x] How much effort it will take to deploy the solutions.


## NOTES

 - You didn't provide a template in the asignment folder. 
 
 - Drop the quotes at the beginning, you are not writing a book.

 - Lead with the goal, e.g. 
 
     Create a tool to ... better evaluate the risk of extending loans to students
     in order to decrease the long term default rate by 0.5% ...
 
 - The entirety of section one can be condensed to a sentnce to two. 
   You can assume that your audience is versed in your industry/topic. 

 - You need to make your goal specific to your project not generally, i.e. save 
   $2.75 billions per year    
  
 - You need to restate how your model success metrics. 50% correct prediction is
   easy. Predict everything doesn't default.  Your success will be 95%+.
  
 - You need to clearly specify how your model(s) will be evaluated. 
 
 - Please fix these and resubmit.
