title: "Rubric: Formal Problem Statement"
output: github_document
---

Template
 - [x] Created an rstudio template for the *FPS*
 
FPS Should:

 - Introduction: 
   - [ ] State the **specific** business problem in the title/first sentence or paragraph.
   - [ ] Identified one or more specific decision(s) that will be helped. 
   
 - [x] Identify key roles: management, owners, stakeholders, users, SMEs, etc.
 - [x] Clearly articulate **why** the project is being considered
 - [ ] Identified "current"" state.

 - Define project's success
   - [x] State what the analysis would do
   - [ ] Estimate benefits of the project 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) a success metric for the project: a single quantifiable, unambiguous 
     metric, that will be used to determine if your project is a success. This is
     not just a technical metrics, but one use at the managerial level. This of
     this is how "the needle must move" by your solution in order to be successful.
   - [ ] Identify any non-quantifiable benefits 
     
 - Define model/analysis success 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) the performance/power of the model or analysis that 
     is necessary to achieve that success to achieve the success.

 - Estimate Risks
   - [ ] What if the success metric is not met?
   - [ ] What if the model performance metric is not met?

 - Deployment
   - [x] Identify **who** the users of the model/analysis are 
   - [ ] Identify **how** the model/analysis will used 
   - [ ] Discuss what changes have to happen within the organization to deploy the model
   - [ ] Discuss risks to model deployment, (e.g. push-back by employees )

 - [x] Propose a timeline for delivery of your project
   - [x] **When** you will have preliminary results of model/analysis performance
   - [x] **When** you need or expect to have determined whether the model performance will be sufficient to solve the problem  
   - [ ] How much effort it will take to deploy the solutions.

 - [x] Is free of grammar/spelling/punctuation mistakes
 
 

## NOTES

 - I don't see your *FPS* or your *template* 
 
 - Background is irrelevant, you should assume that your audience knows
   what the NBA is.  Get directly to your point: 
   
    "The goal of this project is to assembly the best picks to keep the
     team under the salary cap limitation ..."
    
 - You do a good job in breaking this into a number of subproblems. 

 - You project cannot succeed you have not created any sort of benchmarks
   for evaluating your project.  At the project level or model level. 
   You must do this.
   
 - This is not a great effort.  Review the rubric above. Fix all problems
   and submit them with the final project.
   
 - Your risks are not risks, they are next steps.
