output: github_document
---

Template
 - [x] Created an rstudio template for the *FPS*
 
FPS Should:

 - Introduction: 
   - [x] State the business problem in the title/first sentence or paragraph.
   - [x] Identified one or more specific decision(s) that will be helped. 
   
 - [x] Identify key roles: management, owners, stakeholders, users, SMEs, etc.
 - [x] Clearly articulate **why** the project is being considered
 - [-] Identified "current"" state.

 - Define project's success
   - [x] State what the analysis would do
   - [x] Estimate benefits of the project 
   - [x] Define/quantify (very precisely) a success metric for the project: a single quantifiable, unambiguous 
     metric, that will be used to determine if your project is a success. This is
     not just a technical metrics, but one use at the managerial level. This of
     this is how "the needle must move" by your solution in order to be successful.
   - [x] Identify any non-quantifiable benefits 
     
 - Define model/analysis success 
   - [x] Define/quantify (very precisely) the performance/power of the model or analysis that 
     is necessary to achieve that success to achieve the success.

 - Estimate Risks
   - [x] What if the success metric is not met?
   - [x] What if the model performance metric is not met?

 - Deployment
   - [x] Identify **who** the users of the model/analysis are 
   - [x] Identify **how** the model/analysis will used 
   - [ ] Discuss what changes have to happen within the organization to deploy the model
   - [ ] Discuss risks to model deployment, (e.g. push-back by employees )

 - [x] Propose a timeline for delivery of your project
   - [ ] **When** you will have preliminary results of model/analysis performance
   - [ ] **When** you need or expect to have determined whether the model performance will be sufficient to solve the problem  
   - [ ] How much effort it will take to deploy the solutions.

 - [x] Is free of grammar/spelling/punctuation mistakes
 

## NOTES

 - Good *FPS*
 
 - Given that the audience is familar with the problem a detailed background is unnecessary.
 
 - Other than that your pretty much touch on everything here. Good job.
