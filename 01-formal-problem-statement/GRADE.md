 - [x] Clearly articulate **why** the project is being considered

 - Define project's success
   - [x] State what the analysis would do
   - [ ] Estimate benefits of the project 
   - [-] Define/quantify (very precisely) a success metric for the project: a single quantifiable, unambiguous 
     metric, that will be used to determine if your project is a success. This is
     not just a technical metrics, but one use at the managerial level. This of
     this is how "the needle must move" by your solution in order to be successful.

 - Define model/analysis success 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) the performance/power of the model or analysis that 
     is necessary to achieve that success to achieve the success.

 - Estimate Risks
   - [x] What if the success metric is not met?
   - [ ] What if the model performance metric is not met?

   - [x] **When** you will have preliminary results of model/analysis performance
   - [x] **When** you need or expect to have determined whether the model performance 
   - [x] How much effort it will take to deploy the solutions.


## NOTES

 - No template submitted. Please resubmit.
 
 - This is a good effort. 
 
 - You should state a goal for the *project* and not rely on sone ambiguous 
   success rate number, e.g. an increase in the success rate by 5%.
   
 - Presumably you are attempting to pick the probability of a successful sale.
   You should explicitly state this.
