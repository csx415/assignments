title: "Rubric: Formal Problem Statement"
output: github_document
---

Template
 - [x] Created an rstudio template for the *FPS*
 
FPS Should:

 - Introduction: 
   - [ ] State the business problem in the title/first sentence or paragraph.
   - [ ] Identified one or more specific decision(s) that will be helped. 
   
 - [x] Identify key roles: management, owners, stakeholders, users, SMEs, etc.
 - [x] Clearly articulate **why** the project is being considered
 - [ ] Identified "current"" state.

 - Define project's success
   - [ ] State what the analysis would do
   - [ ] Estimate benefits of the project 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) a success metric for the project: a single quantifiable, unambiguous 
     metric, that will be used to determine if your project is a success. This is
     not just a technical metrics, but one use at the managerial level. This of
     this is how "the needle must move" by your solution in order to be successful.
   - [-] Identify any non-quantifiable benefits 
     
 - Define model/analysis success 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) the performance/power of the model or analysis that 
     is necessary to achieve that success to achieve the success.

 - Estimate Risks
   - [ ] What if the success metric is not met?
   - [ ] What if the model performance metric is not met?

 - Deployment
   - [x] Identify **who** the users of the model/analysis are 
   - [ ] Identify **how** the model/analysis will used 
   - [ ] Discuss what changes have to happen within the organization to deploy the model
   - [ ] Discuss risks to model deployment, (e.g. push-back by employees )

 - [x] Propose a timeline for delivery of your project
   - [x] **When** you will have preliminary results of model/analysis performance
   - [x] **When** you need or expect to have determined whether the model performance will be sufficient to solve the problem  
   - [x] How much effort it will take to deploy the solutions.

 - [x] Is free of grammar/spelling/punctuation mistakes
 

## NOTES

 - Please knit your work.
 
 - I like this project even though there is no predictive componenet, it is 
   purely inferrential which is great. Make sure that you are using the correct
   inference tests for your comparisons.  
 
 - You need to improve this when you incorporate in the final project. See the 
   above checklist and enhance this for the final project.
 
 - You can omit boilerplate and cute straight to the chase: "The goal of this project
   is to reduce energy consumption by ... using a model that will ..."
   
 - You need be specific in terms of how the project and analyses will be evaluated. 
   You need to put a stick in the ground here and say what your project is trying
   to achieve and what each analysis will trigger. For example: "It is expected that
   these analyses will result in a 2.5% reduction in energy consumption"  and 
   "An analysis that indicates a cost-neutral energy savings of 5% or more will
   be considered"  (Making stuff up -- which is alright since the *FPS* purpose is
   to promote conversation.)
