title: "Rubric: Formal Problem Statement"
output: github_document
---

Template
 - [x] Created an rstudio template for the *FPS*
 
FPS Should:

 - Introduction: 
   - [x] State the business problem in the title/first sentence or paragraph.
   - [ ] Identified one or more specific decision(s) that will be helped. 
   
 - [x] Identify key roles: management, owners, stakeholders, users, SMEs, etc.
 - [x] Clearly articulate **why** the project is being considered
 - [ ] Identified "current"" state.

 - Define project's success
   - [x] State what the analysis would do
   - [x] Estimate benefits of the project 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) a success metric for the project: a single quantifiable, unambiguous 
     metric, that will be used to determine if your project is a success. This is
     not just a technical metrics, but one use at the managerial level. This of
     this is how "the needle must move" by your solution in order to be successful.
   - [-] Identify any non-quantifiable benefits 
     
 - Define model/analysis success 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) the performance/power of the model or analysis that 
     is necessary to achieve that success to achieve the success.

 - Estimate Risks
   - [ ] What if the success metric is not met?
   - [ ] What if the model performance metric is not met?

 - Deployment
   - [ ] Identify **who** the users of the model/analysis are 
   - [ ] Identify **how** the model/analysis will used 
   - [ ] Discuss what changes have to happen within the organization to deploy the model
   - [x] Discuss risks to model deployment, (e.g. push-back by employees )

 - [x] Propose a timeline for delivery of your project
   - [x] **When** you will have preliminary results of model/analysis performance
   - [x] **When** you need or expect to have determined whether the model performance will be sufficient to solve the problem  
   - [x] How much effort it will take to deploy the solutions.

 - [x] Is free of grammar/spelling/punctuation mistakes
 

## NOTES

 - This is a good solid effort.
 
 - I am left with a question of how a prediction of the funding for a KS project
   will lead to an increase in ROI for AIU. There may be one, but I don't 
   understand what that is. 
   
 - At one point you estimate the benefits at 10% at another it's 20%.
 
 - You should think about the decision that your analysis/model will inform. 
 
 - You don't really need boilerplate section such as *About Us* 
 
 - You need to be clearer how you intend to deploy your model and how it will be
   consumed. For example, "Funding Levels will be written to the AIU database. It
   will be a list of kickstarter id's and the predicted funding level at the 
   start of the project"
