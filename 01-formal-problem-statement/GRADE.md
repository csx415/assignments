Template
 - [x] Created an rstudio template for the *FPS*
 
FPS Should:

 - Introduction: 
   - [ ] State the business problem in the title/first sentence or paragraph.
   - [ ] Identified one or more specific decision(s) that will be helped. 
   
 - [ ] Identify key roles: management, owners, stakeholders, users, SMEs, etc.
 - [ ] Clearly articulate **why** the project is being considered
 - [ ] Identified "current"" state.

 - Define project's success
   - [ ] State what the analysis would do
   - [ ] Estimate benefits of the project 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) a success metric for the project: a single quantifiable, unambiguous 
     metric, that will be used to determine if your project is a success. This is
     not just a technical metrics, but one use at the managerial level. This of
     this is how "the needle must move" by your solution in order to be successful.
   - [ ] Identify any non-quantifiable benefits 
     
 - Define model/analysis success 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) the performance/power of the model or analysis that 
     is necessary to achieve that success to achieve the success.

 - Estimate Risks
   - [ ] What if the success metric is not met?
   - [ ] What if the model performance metric is not met?

 - Deployment
   - [x] Identify **who** the users of the model/analysis are 
   - [-] Identify **how** the model/analysis will used 
   - [ ] Discuss what changes have to happen within the organization to deploy the model
   - [ ] Discuss risks to model deployment, (e.g. push-back by employees )

 - [ ] Propose a timeline for delivery of your project
   - [ ] **When** you will have preliminary results of model/analysis performance
   - [ ] **When** you need or expect to have determined whether the model performance will be sufficient to solve the problem  
   - [ ] How much effort it will take to deploy the solutions.

 - [ ] Is free of grammar/spelling/punctuation mistakes
 

## NOTES

 - This is a poor effort and needs (a lot of )work.
 
 - It is not acceptable for submission as a serious project. No reasonable 
   person proceed with this project given this level of effort. 
   
 - You need to re-write this completely and resubmit with your final project. If
   you don't fix this there is no possible way this project can succeed since you
   have really not defined success criteria.
   
 - Please use complete senetences
 
 - Your goals are unclear; 
 
 - You have failed to create a measure for evaluating your project.
 
 - The audience for this is not technical.
