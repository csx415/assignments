Template
 - [x] Created an rstudio template for the *FPS*
 
FPS Should:

 - Introduction: 
   - [x] State the business problem in the title/first sentence or paragraph.
   - [x] Identified one or more specific decision(s) that will be helped. 
   
 - [ ] Identify key roles: management, owners, stakeholders, users, SMEs, etc.
 - [ ] Clearly articulate **why** the project is being considered
 - [ ] Identified "current"" state.

 - Define project's success
   - [-] State what the analysis would do
   - [ ] Estimate benefits of the project 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) a success metric for the project: a single quantifiable, unambiguous 
     metric, that will be used to determine if your project is a success. This is
     not just a technical metrics, but one use at the managerial level. This of
     this is how "the needle must move" by your solution in order to be successful.
   - [ ] Identify any non-quantifiable benefits 
     
 - Define model/analysis success 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) the performance/power of the model or analysis that 
     is necessary to achieve that success to achieve the success.

 - Estimate Risks
   - [ ] What if the success metric is not met?
   - [ ] What if the model performance metric is not met?

 - Deployment
   - [x] Identify **who** the users of the model/analysis are 
   - [x] Identify **how** the model/analysis will used 
   - [ ] Discuss what changes have to happen within the organization to deploy the model
   - [ ] Discuss risks to model deployment, (e.g. push-back by employees )

 - [x] Propose a timeline for delivery of your project
   - [x] **When** you will have preliminary results of model/analysis performance
   - [x] **When** you need or expect to have determined whether the model performance 
   - [ ] How much effort it will take to deploy the solutions.

 - [ ] Is free of grammar/spelling/punctuation mistakes
 

## NOTES

 - Generally, this is a poor effort in communicating to the business owners what
   your model is trying to achieve and the benefits that it will yield. You will 
   need to spend time working the FPS to be submitted as part of the final 
   project.
   
 - It is unclear what "loan approval parameters are"
 
 - Does the Lending Club data set indicate which loans were NPL?  Why is "accepted"" NPL?
   By reference specific data columns you have invited in questions to the business user(s)
   that should not be in this document.
 
 - You should not specify technical details in this document such as 60% of the data 
   should be used for training. Not only is it a bad methodology, the detail does 
   not need to be communicated to the business.
   
 - Your FPS lacks specificity around its goals/metrics. Your proposed solution 
   will not succeed within the organization because of this.
