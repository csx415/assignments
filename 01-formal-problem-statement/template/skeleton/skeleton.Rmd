## 1. Goal
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# HINT:
# Define: **What**
# It should be a business description of the problem statement, not the technical aspects
# describing the model.
```

&nbsp;

## 2. Key Stakeholders
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# HINT:
# Define: **Who**
# "Business Owners" are the key stakeholders requesting the solution of the problem.
# "SMEs" are those who know the domain well.
# "Customers / Consumers" are the people who will consume the solution.
# *Note*: It is often possible that the Business Owners and Customers are the same set of people.
```  
### a. Business Owners
### b. SMEs
### c. Customers

&nbsp;

## 3. Impact
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# HINT:
# Define: **Why**
# Quantify the importance and impact of this project. What happens if we do not do it.
# Have both measurable and indirect impacts listed.
```

&nbsp;

## 4. Execution Plan
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# HINT: 
# Define: **How**
# Remember, only define "how", not implement it. Do NOT discuss implementation details like
# the type of models which will be used in the solution.
```
### a. Data Sources
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# HINT:
# If it known where the data will come from, mention it. Remember, do not write the details
# of how the data will be cleaned up and/or processed. Just list the high level sources and
# nature of data.
```

&nbsp;

## 5. Deployment Plan
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# HINT: 
# Define: **How and Where**
# Discuss how the models built will be deployed and where. What will be the process to 
# test/update the models?
```

&nbsp;

## 6. Resources
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# HINT:
# It may make sense to estimate the amount of resources this project will require. If the
# project requires any specialized environment or hardware to be deployed and run, mention it.
```
### a. Human Resources
### b. Machine Resources

&nbsp;

## 7. Major Milestones
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# HINT:
# Define: **When**
# Define an ETA for each of the below mentioned stages of the project lifecycle.
```
The first version of the project will take ___ weeks to complete.

| Estimated Start Date | ETA        |
|:--------------------:|:----------:|
| MM/DD/YYYY           | MM/DD/YYYY |
   
During this period, the following major milestones will be tracked.

### a. **Ingest**:
Data exploration, clean-up and ingestion will take ___ weeks and is estimated to be completed by MM/DD/YYYY.

### b. **Model**:
Model(s) will be built on the ingested data and will take ___ weeks. The will be available for validation by MM/DD/YYYY.

### c. **Validate**:
Model(s) will be tested against the new live/offline/bucketed data for validation. This test will run for ___ weeks. Estimated Start Date: MM/DD/YYYY, Estimated End Date: MM/DD/YYYY.

### d. **Deploy**:
If accepted, the model(s) will be deployed to production. Deployment plan is as discussed earlier. Deployment process will take ___ days. ETA: MM/DD/YYYY.

### e. **Iterate**:
Plans to iterate for next version, if any.

*All dates are tentatively estimated based on the expected start date. Exact milestone dates will be known when the project starts.
