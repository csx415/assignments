## 1. Goal
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# HINT:
# Define: **What**
# It should be a business description of the problem statement, not the technical aspects
# describing the model.
```

&nbsp;

## 2. Key Stakeholders
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# HINT:
# Define: **Who**
# "Business Owners" are the key stakeholders requesting the solution of the problem.
# "Customers / Consumers" are the people who will consume the solution.
# *Note*: It is often possible that the Business Owners and Customers are the same set of people.
```  
### a. Business Owners
### b. Customers

&nbsp;

## 3. Impact
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# HINT:
# Define: **Why**
# Quantify the importance and impact of this project. What happens if we do not do it.
# Have both measurable and indirect impacts listed.
```

&nbsp;

## 4. Execution Plan
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# HINT: 
# Define: **How**
# Remember, only define "how", not implement it. Do NOT discuss implementation details like
# the type of models which will be used in the solution.
```
### a. Data Sources
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# HINT:
# If it known where the data will come from, mention it. Remember, do not write the details
# of how the data will be cleaned up and/or processed. Just list the high level sources and
# nature of data.
```

&nbsp;

## 5. Deployment Plan
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# HINT: 
# Define: **How and Where**
# Discuss how the models built will be deployed and where. What will be the process to 
# test/update the models?
```

&nbsp;

## 6. Resources
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# HINT:
# It may make sense to estimate the amount of resources this project will require. If the
# project requires any specialized environment or hardware to be deployed and run, mention it.
```
### a. Human Resources
### b. Machine Resources

&nbsp;

## 7. Major Milestones
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# HINT:
# Define: **When**
# Define an ETA for each of the below mentioned stages of the project lifecycle.
```
### a. **Ingest**:
Data clean-up and ingestion will be completed by MM/DD/YYYY.

### b. **Model**:
Models will be built on the ingested data and will be available for validation by MM/DD/YYYY.

### c. **Validate**:
Scoring to be tested on live traffic by MM/DD/YYYY.

### d. **Deploy**:
If accepted, the model(s) will be deployed to production by MM/DD/YYYY.

### e. **Iterate**:
Plans to iterate for next version.

## 8. Success Criteria
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# HINT:
# Define: Measurement
# The business measurement. For example, CTR should increase by X%.
```
The success of this project will be measured by ___ . It's value should increase/decrease by __ %.

&nbsp;

## 9. Risks
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# HINT:
# Define: Possibilities when things go unexpectedly
# Risk mitigation plan, if any.
```
The prossible risks to this project are...
