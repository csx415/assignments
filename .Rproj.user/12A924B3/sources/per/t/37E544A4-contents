Recap of lecture from last week
ML algorithms 3 features: restricted class, loss function, way to optimize

Improving models: 3 methods
  add features
  add more data (observations) to reduce variance
  change model types

**robert hyndman (wrote forecast package)**

Feature selection
1.  PCA
2.  Correlation w/ response variable, with other predictors
3.  Feature importance

Ridge, lasso (regression problems)

Combine features:
  lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, mtcars)
  
Interaction terms:
  lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl + (wt*cyl)) # weight and cylinder behave synergistically
  lm(mpg ~ (wt + cyl)^2)
  poly() # Does expansion
  ?model.formula
  ?poly
  ?I # interaction
  
devtools::load_all(path) # loads packages from path
pkgKitten() like devtools

Measurement
  quantity
  often not important to businness
  
Metric
  quantity
  related to phenomenon
  calculated to one or emore measurements
  related to perceived value
  can also be a measure
  is important to business
  
  How do we id metric?
  
  cheap, good, fast: informs of potential measures of a project or process.
  
  Looking for model to dirput a process.
  
  Cheap
    cost
    return/revenue
    profit
    counting dollars or effort
    
  Good
    high quality
    # of good parts produced
    # of complaints/failures
    
Fast
  speed/volume
  quantity, throughput
  
cost ~ quality + volume

new technology can get benefits along all three axes. is disruptive force, adding new tech to existing process in disruptive way that avoids the "pick two".

How to decide metrics?
  improve one of measures
  consider ratio metrics (e.g. cost/quality, cost/volume, volumen/quality)
  
  
Classification metrics
  pick up next week
