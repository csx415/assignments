## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load_library_and_project}

library("ProjectTemplate")

library("data.table")

setwd("~/R/AirlineDelayAndCancellationsAnalysis")

load.project()

```

## Analyse flight delays
```{r analyze flight delays}

alldelays <- data.frame(flights$AIRLINE, flights$DEPARTURE_DELAY)

alldelays[is.na(alldelays)] <- 0

alldelaysagg <- aggregate(alldelays$flights.DEPARTURE_DELAY, by=list(alldelays$flights.AIRLINE), FUN=sum )

fdelay <- alldelaysagg[order(-alldelaysagg$x),]

setnames(fdelay,"Group.1","IATA_CODE")

setnames(fdelay,"x","Total Delays")

fmdelay <- merge(x=fdelay,y=airlines,by="IATA_CODE",all=TRUE)

fsdelay <- fmdelay[order(-fmdelay$`Total Delays`),]

```

```{r find average flight delay per flight}
flights$FLIGHT_INSTANCE <- 1

allfilghtsinstance <- aggregate(flights$FLIGHT_INSTANCE, by=list(flights$AIRLINE), FUN=sum )

setnames(allfilghtsinstance, "Group.1", "IATA_CODE")

setnames(allfilghtsinstance, "x", "NumFlights")

aggf = merge(x=allfilghtsinstance,y=fmdelay,by="IATA_CODE",all=TRUE)

aggf$ave_delay <- (aggf$`Total Delays` * 1.0) / aggf$NumFlights

aggfs <- aggf[order(-aggf$ave_delay),]

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Sorted Flight Total Delays, echo=FALSE}

aggfsplot <- data.frame(aggfs$NumFlights, aggfs$`Total Delays`, aggfs$ave_delay)

plot(aggfsplot)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
